ELASTIC FILE SYSTEM
========================
NFS:NFS (Network File System) is a protocol that allows users to access and 
manage files stored on a remote server as if they were local, enabling
 seamless file sharing across a network, especially in Linux and Unix environments. 
=================================================

Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) is a fully managed, cloud-native file system 
designed for Linux-based applications and workloads, providing 
shared file storage accessible by multiple EC2 instances
=======================================


1.CREATE 2 LINUX EC2 SERVER MACHINES WITH SECURITY GROUP ATTACHED +  ec2-USER DATA FOR 
CONNECTING APACHE WEB SERVER in differnt availbity zones 

2.SECURITY GROUP ATTCAHED SHOULD BE ALL TRAFFIC ENABLED FOR WEB SERVERs

3.CREATE NEW SECURITY GROUP FOR NFS(NETWORK FILE SYSTEM )......
*****INBOUND RULES=====NFS ============SELECT THE SECURTY GROUP WHICH IS CREATED ===
(WHO CAN ACCESS THE WEB SERVER)

*********OUTBOUND RULES ====ALL TRAFFIC =======CUSTOM ======0.0.0.0/0

4.CREATE NEW EFS (SERVICE SECTION )........
*******NAME:MY_WEB_SERVER_EFS
*******VPC= CLICK ON CUSTOMIZE
******FILE SYSTEM TYPE =
*******UNCHECK THE BOX (ENABLE AUTOMATIC BACKUP)
******NEXT*******MOUNT TARGETS ***********REMOVE OLD SECURITY GROUPS ----ADD THE NFS 
SECURITY GROUP FOR THE MOUNT TARGETS 
**********NEXT*********NEXT************CREATE-----------

5.CONNECT THE 2 SERVERS .......AND INSTALL ----NFS UTILS PACKAGE ON BOTH SERVERS-----
#SUDO SU
#yum install -y amazon-efs-utils

6.IN BOTH MACHINES ----go for EFS WHICH IS CREATED,AND ATTACH, + MOUNT EFS POINT 
IN "/var/www/html" path
#sudo mount -t efs -o tls fs-01d1a34449cbc3c43:/ /var/www/html

7.IN ANY ONE INSTANCES CREATE THE HTML FILE IN THE /VAR/WWW/HTML PATH
#cd /var/www/html
#vi apponix.html
this is my first web page 
 

8.WHEN PUBLIC IP IS CONNECTED ---------------WEB SERVER SHOULD BE AVAILBLE IN THE 2ND 
SERVER ALSO 

9. CREATE ONE MORE INSTANCES WITH ALL SAME CONFIG ==========BUT WITHOUT CONNECTION 
----------WEB PAGE HAS TO LAUNCH -------WITH THE USER DATA DETAILS.......
